# Deficientezinho task ledger

Every task carries an ID of the form `DEF-<n>`. IDs are assigned once,
never reused, and never renumbered.

**Next ID to assign: `DEF-4`**

If this file and history ever disagree, history wins:

```sh
git log --oneline | grep -oE 'DEF-[0-9]+' | sort -t- -k2 -n | tail -1
```
